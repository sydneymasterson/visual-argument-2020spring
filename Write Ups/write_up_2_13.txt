My project aims to bring attention to the pink tax. My original thought was to put images of specific company’s products, but I instead ending up using general cartoon images to represent the products affect by the pink tax. I found that they were more aesthetically pleasing and applied to broader statistics. Using the broader statistics instead of only specific examples shows that these are not one-off instances. I still chose to include one specific example of the phenomenon of the Bick razors because it’s a very familiar brand that a lot of viewers probably own themselves. This shows the viewer that, whether they realize it or not, they are personally affected by the pink tax.
When creating the background, I decided to make half of it pink and half of it a more “masculine” color. I did this because a lot of the times the pink tax is applied to a product marketed to women, the main difference between it and its male-marketed partner product is that woman’s product is pink or another “feminine” color.
The written statistics are printed over the black symbols in bolded white text. While they are not the largest font or visual in the project, I wanted them to be easily visible and pop off the page. Some vague, buzzer phrase like “pink tax” is easy to push to the back of your mind or completely overlook. However, actual statistics and numbers are harder to ignore.
The biggest thing in the project is the text, “PINK tax.” However, it is somewhat subdued, and each word is a different shade of the same color as its background. While it is a catchy name, the most important part of the argument is still the statistics. Since the title is already large and centered, I chose to keep the text with the numbers as the brightest part of the project.
