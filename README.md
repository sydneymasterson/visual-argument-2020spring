Hello! Welcome to my visual argument project, "Let's Talk About It."

First thing's first - yes, I did put a blood stain on a cartoon woman. I know this could be considered crude or graphic, but let's talk about that. It's a cartoon. It is by know means realistic. Still, it grabs our attention because the topic of menstruation is so greatly tabooed, even though a large percentage of the population experiences it.

Because it feels like we can't talk about periods, period poverty has been allowed to continue existing in the US. Menstrual products are one of the most requested items in homeless shelters and 20% of teens have struggled to afford the products they need just to be able to leave their houses.

So, sorry if it's uncomfortable to talk about, but imagine how much more uncomfortable it is for the people who actually experience it. For them, we have to talk about it.

That is what I made my project for. To call attention to this issue and help start a conversation and normalize talking about an all to common project.
