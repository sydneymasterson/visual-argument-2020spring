I switched gears for the newest version of my visual argument project because I didn’t think there was anywhere to go with my old project. My newer version of the project focuses on one of the specific statistics used in my old version – the fact that 34 US states tax feminine hygiene products as a luxury. This only adds to the fact that many girls and woman cannot afford them and are forced to stay home from school, work, and life while on their period. How is being able to leave the house a luxury? Basically, this is just a tax for being a woman and it is absolutely insane that this is still a thing in well over half of the states in the United States in 2020. 
One in four teenagers have reported having to miss class because they don’t have access to feminine hygiene products. Access to education is a basic right for children, yet menstruating woman are taxed for the ability to go to school. This is something that really stuck with me, so I chose to make it the main argument for my visual project. 
I started but importing four figure of woman – the kind from the bathroom signs – and blacking out one of them. This symbolized the one in four teenagers missing class due to not having period products. I also chose to include a blood stain. I understand that this could possibly be uncomfortable for viewers but I decided it was important to include. Basically my thought process was, if even just looking at a cartoon version of the problem is uncomfortable, imagine the discomfort for the people directly impacted by this problem. 
A lot of the reason that this problem has been going on for so long is that not that many people even know about it. Menstruation is a highly tabooed topic, even though a huge chunk of the populstion experiences it. Women’s health is human health and should not be stigmatized to talk about. By destigmatizing this conversation, hopefully we can begin to move forward and fix the injustice of the pink tax.
